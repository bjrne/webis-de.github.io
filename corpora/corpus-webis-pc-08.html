<p>The Webis plagiarism corpus 2008 (Webis-PC-08) is a corpus for the evaluation of automatic plagiarism detection algorithms. For research purposes the corpus can be used free of charge, however, since the documents in the corpus are not free of copyrights we need assurance that you have legal access to the ACM digital library.</p>

<h2 id="webis-research">Research</h2>

<p>Today's research on plagiarism detection lacks the availability of a reference collection of plagiarism cases which can be used as a yardstick to compare different detection approaches. In our project <a href="en/media/chairs/webis/research/selected-projects/plagiarism-detection">Picapica.net</a> we have set up a corpus of artificial plagiarism cases: 101 monographs were collected from the ACM digital library, and to each of them chunks of text from other monographs were added manually. This was done in various ways in order to simulate two different kinds of plagiarism, accurate copies and modified copies. Cross-language plagiarism cases are currently not part of the corpus. The corpus is suited for the evaluation of external plagiarism detection algorithms, but also for intrinsic plagiarism detection algorithms such as writing style analyses.</p>
