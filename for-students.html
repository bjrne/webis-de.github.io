7 research positions in the fields of Information Retrieval, Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Data Analytics at the Webis group.
</strong></p>
<p>
The Webis group (webis.de) is a tightly cooperating research network, formed by computer science chairs at the universities of Halle, Leipzig, Paderborn, and Weimar. Our mission is to tackle challenges of the information society by carrying out basic and applied research with the goal of prototyping and evaluating future information systems.
</p>
<p>
The Webis group is offering 7 research positions in the fields of Information Retrieval, Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Data Analytics. The offered positions can be filled with graduates or postdocs and will belong to the respective computer science departments: one position at the University of Halle (Prof. Hagen), and three positions each at University of Leipzig (Prof. Potthast) and the Bauhaus-Universität Weimar (Prof. Stein). Salary is based on the collective agreement for the public sector in Germany, TV-L 13, 100%. The engagement should start in January 2020 and is limited by the project duration, which varies between 2 years and 4.5 years; an extension is possible and will be pursued.
</p>
<p>
The offered positions deal with innovations and recent developments in the cross-section of the aforementioned fields, but provide a different focus each: conversational search, authorship analysis, data and experiment retrieval, computational ethics, and user simulation. We will discuss possible specializations with the invited candidates in order to make an optimum match regarding individual research interests and qualifications. We expect the prospective candidates to carry out innovative research, aiming at the relevant international conferences. The offered positions are considered as qualification positions, i.e., for non-Postdocs we support to do a PhD (Dr. rer. nat.).
</p>
<p>
Prospective candidates should have finished either a master or a PhD in computer science, mathematics, or a related field with excellent or very good grades. A solid background in mathematics and statistics is expected---as well as very good programming skills.
</p>
<p>
We are an experienced research group where team spirit and active collaboration has top priority. We are looking for open-minded graduates and PhDs who want to develop both as a researcher and as a person. The working language of our group is English; fluency in German is not required.
</p>
<p>
Interested and qualified candidates are invited to submit the following documents (preferably electronically as a single PDF file): a cover letter describing yourself and your interests, a detailed CV, high school graduation (Abitur) certificate, academic transcripts stating courses taken and grades received, and a list of publications (if any).
</p>
<p>
We are interested to increase the percentage of women in computer science research and particularly welcome applications from suitably qualified women. We do not discriminate on the basis of religion, color, gender, age, or disability, and are committed to a family-friendly hiring policy.
