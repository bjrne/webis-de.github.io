SECTION Synopsis

<h2><a id="synopsis"></a>Synopsis</h2>
<p> The PHOENIX project is a cooperative project funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF). The aim of the project is to reflect on the practice of scientific authorship and scientific writing in the context of the changing function of authorship, diverging disciplinary writing practices as well as the changed cooperation and production conditions resulting from digitalisation. It will examine in detail how scientific texts are produced today and what the changed processes of producing scientific texts mean for quality assurance mechanisms in universities and non-university R&D institutions. 

Studying the reuse of text is of central importance for this task. Citing, paraphrasing, summarizing - and plagiarizing - are fundamental techniques in the creation of knowledge. However, it is still largely unknown how widespread the reuse of text is in current scientific writing. This is primarily due to the fact that the required technologies and sufficient data in digital form have only recently become available.

Compiling a corpus of over millions of scientific articles, the first quantitative foray into the practices of scientifc text reuse is provided by developing and applying state-of-the-art reuse detection techniques and an accompanying large-scale analysis, resulting in a discipline-specific, time-dependent typology of actual text reuse occurring in science.
